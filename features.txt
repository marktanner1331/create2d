color picker
    shows when a user needs to pick a color
    stays open after they have picked a color
        so that they can pick again
    can be closed manually
    closes automatically when property window changes
        e.g. a different tool is chosen
            a different tab is clicked
            all lines are deselected
    but we do want to keep it open upon selection changes

settings
    autocollapse property groups so that only one is open at a time
