tools:
    panning:
        need to temporarily switch to the pan tool when space is down
        this is so mouse events on the canvas dont get sent to the active tool
        
        need to keep a reference to the draggable controller in mainWindow
        so that we can reuse it, and destroy it after panning has finished
        
        also need to start panning immediately if we have clicked from the tool

rendering lines that are connected and have the same properties should have their join styles joined better
    at the moment 'miter' and 'bevel' don't work
    this can be solved by implementing a new interface for anything that implements the line mixin
    maybe pass through a bool in renderToStageXL() which says don't paint paths
    leaving path painting to the very end
    i.e. the last path in the shape that has the same properties
    it will mean slightly slower rendering, but shouldn't be too bad

finish zoom panel
    and put it in the menu

deleting shapes shouldn't delete vertices that are used in other non-selected shapes

ability to enter calculations into pixels per unit

need keyboard arrows for moving vertices

ability to select a shape and 'disconnect' from other shapes

every shape owns its own vertices, vertices cannot be shared among shapes
    instead, every shape can have a set of insignificant vertices
    which get moved when the significant vertices also moved
    this way a line can join another line halfway along
    and that is treated the same as if it was joined at the end
    ignore that
    when two shapes are joined and we want to select their shared vertex
    then we want to be able to move both shapes
    the shapes really do need to share the same vertex
    but we still want insignificant vertices for the rest

need a command palette + script runner

resize boxes

drag box to select

undo/redo
    ability to export these as scripts

we also have helper vertices, such as teh control point for bexier splines

remove no_select class and make all text non selectable by default

rename the html ids for the canvasTabButton to just canvasButton and others

rename draggable/draggableController for something more sensible (i.e. stageXL/html)

color picker needs to use new resetPreviewColor() in all places (instead of manually setting the preview color)

in NumberFieldWithLabel.dart
    keep a copy of the original value (at the point of a onFocus)
    if the user deletes the value and unfocuses - default back to the original value

vertex snapping tolerance needs to be calculated from the canvas scale
    right now its hardcoded in canvas space, so a smaller canvas would have stronger snapping than a larger one
