move the logic in Property Window into its own controller to move objects

in NumberFieldWithLabel.dart
    keep a copy of the original value (at the point of a onFocus)
    if the user deletes the value and unfocuses - default back to the original value

custom cursors that actually snap

    right now its hardcoded in canvas space, so a smaller canvas would have stronger snapping than a larger one
