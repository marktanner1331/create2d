move the logic in Property Window into its own controller to move objects

remove no_select class and make all text non selectable by default

rename the html ids for the canvasTabButton to just canvasButton and others

rename draggable/draggableController for something more sensible (i.e. stageXL/html)

color picker needs to use new resetPreviewColor() in all places (instead of manually setting the preview color)

lazy load the color picker tabs

color picker close button doesnt work

group controllers need onEnter/onExit as they might have open color pickers that need cleaning up

in NumberFieldWithLabel.dart
    keep a copy of the original value (at the point of a onFocus)
    if the user deletes the value and unfocuses - default back to the original value

vertex snapping tolerance needs to be calculated from the canvas scale
    right now its hardcoded in canvas space, so a smaller canvas would have stronger snapping than a larger one

what i want is layers for the canvas
    canvas BG
    grid
    drawing
    selection layer
    resize layer
the problem is that some things need scaling
    such as the drawing layer
others only need translation
    such as the grid
so we probably want the layer itself to handle that
but we want to put as much as possible on the main Window
    also, if the canvas isn't controlling the grid anymore
    then this is a problem
    as we might have mutliple canvasses
    with multiple grids
    so how do we do it?
        have one set of everything? and just swap out their target?
    or have some container class, that is the overarching controller?
        and can be swapped out by the main window?
    i like the single version of everything
        so like MainWindow.currentCanvas still?
        but currentCanvas will be a layer too?
        currentCanvas no longer owns things like grid
        so it doesn't make sense for it to own its properties
        maybe mainWindow should own the grid properties?
        and try and make mainWindow global?
        so we don't have a currentCanvas?
        but maybe we still need some kind of container, for the drawing layers?
        it's handy
            especially for the tools
            and the events
        so maybe currentCanvas is still a thing
            and it does contain all the different layers still
            and can be swapped out if necessary
            in that case, maybe a lot of the layers can directly reference the canvas
            and prefabs can swap out for a new canvas
                easier than having to temporarily store the state of the canvas? not really
                downside is that the canvas will now need to scale its own stuff
                i.e. will have to give a new transformationMatrix to go from device space to drawing space
                rather than the canvas itself being scaled
                im not sure i mind that 
                but it is nice just to go canvas.transformationMatrix
                although we can now go canvas.drawingSpaceToDeviceSpace
                    and canvas.deviceSpaceToDrawingSpace
                maybe we have the best of both
                only one canvas
                    that is owned by the main window
                    that can be loaded into for prefabs
                we can now just call this 'canvas' instead of 'currentCanvas'
                mainWindow still needs to be a thing
                    as it handles the property panels, toolbox, etc
                sorted!


mental dart code for dynamically crawling shapes to see what PropertyMixins they have
can also put in a 'T extends PropertyMixin'
    void main() {
        hasType<Iterable>();
    }

    void hasType<T>() {
        if(List() is T) {
            print("yay");
        }
    }
